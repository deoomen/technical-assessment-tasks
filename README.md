# Technical Assessment Tasks

This repository contains **two technical assessment tasks** focusing on rapid prototyping and agentic coding skills. The tasks are designed to evaluate your approach to **problem-solving** and ability to **quickly create functional prototypes**.

## 🎯 Key Points

1. **Focus on Rapid Prototyping:** These tasks **are NOT** about building **~~production-ready features~~**. We want to see your approach to quick, efficient problem-solving.
2. **Time Expectation:** you decide - the greater results brought faster would be much more appreciated than *hmmm* - the opposite 😁
3. **Evaluation Priority:** Problem-solving approach > Code completeness
4. **Tool Freedom:** Use any libraries/tools you prefer - the end result matters most

## 💡 What We're Looking For

### Smart Trade-offs:

- Choose what to implement vs what to mock
- Focus on core functionality over complex code
- Document your decisions

### Technical Skills:

- Basic implementation of key features
- Clean, readable code structure
- Understanding of performance considerations

### Problem Solving:

- How you approach complex requirements
- Which shortcuts you take (and why)
- How you document your thought process

## 🚀 Tasks Overview

### Smart Nature Observer 
> [Detailed documentation](https://github.com/Szowesgad/technical-assessment-tasks/blob/libraxis/tasks/task-1.md)

1. Video processing prototype
2. Real-time analysis simulation
3. Basic UI for interaction

### Smart Voice Notes Organizer
> [Detailed documentation](https://github.com/Szowesgad/technical-assessment-tasks/blob/libraxis/tasks/task-2.md)

1. Audio processing prototype
2. Text analysis simulation
3. Simple organization interface

## 📝 Getting Started

### Choose Your Focus:

1. Pick the most interesting aspects to implement
2. Mock or simulate complex features
3. Document what you would do with more time

### Quick Setup:

1. Fork this repository
2. Use provided example code as starting point
3. Start with basic functionality

## Submission:

1. Working prototype (even if limited in scope)
2. Documentation of your approach
3. Notes about trade-offs made

## ⚡ Example Approach

### A good prototype might include:

- Basic UI skeleton
- Simulated ML processing
- One or two core features working
- Clear documentation of what's mocked/simulated
- Notes about how you'd expand it in production

### ❓ Questions?

- Open an issue for technical questions
- Contact [team@libraxis.dev] for scope clarification
- We're happy to discuss your approach!

## 🎓 Evaluation Criteria

### We value:

1. Clean, maintainable code
2. Smart architectural decisions
3. Clear documentation of trade-offs
4. Working prototype (even if limited)

### We don't expect:

- Production-ready code
- Full feature implementation
- Perfect error handling
- Complete test coverage
